Some file-based auton stuff.  I was playing with lex and yacc and I think we can use them to parse a custom format here.

Make sure to run setupLexerAndParser.sh before building

Format:

[AutonModeName]
COMMAND PARAMETER TIMEOUT;
COMMAND PARAMETER TIMEOUT;
...
[AutonModeName2]
COMMAND PARAMETER TIMEOUT;
...
